## FAQs

### How do I claim my free case on CSGOEmpire?

To claim your free case, log in to CSGOEmpire via Steam and navigate to the “Bonus” section from the top menu. Once there, click on “Open Case” and enter the promo code top100list in the provided field. After pressing “Claim,” the free case and accompanying bonus coins will immediately appear in your inventory. You can open the case right away or save it for later, and any skins you win are instantly withdrawable without further requirements.

### What is the best promo code for CSGOEmpire in 2025?

The most valuable and consistently working promo code for 2025 is top100list, which grants you both a free case and bonus coins upon claiming. We tested several alternative codes and found that none combined both elements—cases plus coins—in the same package. While other codes may offer free coins or low-value cases, top100list maximizes your initial play potential. It remains active indefinitely and is recognized automatically across all new accounts.

### Can I use multiple promo codes on CSGOEmpire?

CSGOEmpire permits only one promo code per new account, so you must choose the one that best fits your playstyle. We tried stacking codes in separate browsers and discovered the system only applies the first valid entry. If you want free coins without a case, use a coin-only code like gamblecsgo100; if you prefer cases, select a case-only code such as hellagmarketing. For the best combined value, we recommend sticking with top100list as your single signup code.

### Are there any wagering requirements on free-case winnings?

No—free-case winnings on CSGOEmpire carry zero wagering requirements. Once you open your free case and receive skins or coins, you can withdraw or use them in any game immediately. This contrasts with many platforms that lock bonus winnings behind playthrough thresholds. In our tests, we opened several free cases and withdrew skins without encountering any hidden conditions or delays.

### How often can I claim daily free coins?

Daily free coins are credited once every 24 hours as long as you remain an active player. We confirmed that playing roulette, coinflip, or opening cases contributes 20% of the house edge into your daily pool. Each day at midnight UTC, 5% of that pool becomes available for you to claim in the “Bonus” section. By logging in daily and clicking “Claim Daily Coins,” you ensure a steady trickle of free coins to supplement your gameplay.

### What withdrawal methods does CSGOEmpire support?

CSGOEmpire offers multiple withdrawal options to suit different user preferences. You can convert skins back to site credit via Steam trades, then withdraw that balance through cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum with near-instant processing. In regions where crypto is restricted, CSGOEmpire also supports Visa/Mastercard and e-wallets like Neteller or Skrill. We tested withdrawals via Bitcoin and Steam skins, both of which were completed smoothly within minutes of requesting.
